			<p>
				I am a recent college graduate interested in Engineering and Computer Science. Whenever I have the opportunity to teach 
				myself something new, I jump to do so, and I believe that constantly learning and changing is the best way to grow. I am 
				primarily self-taught, and started programing in High School when, out of curiosity, I made a small mod for Minecraft in Java. 
				Since then, my interest and experience have only grown, and I now practice daily. I am constantly amazed by how much complexity 
				there is in even the smallest components of a language, and there is no better feeling than solving a difficult problem by 
				using those small pieces in a unique way.
