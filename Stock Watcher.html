                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal with this project was to create a program which tracks the investments of the user, and monitor's their portfolio's progress over long periods of time. I have always been interested in the stock market and investing, but I don't have practical experience. So I decided to create this program in order to test my investment strategies. I plan to research companies I find interesting, and then input practice investments into those companies through this program, which will update my portfolio every day the stock market is open.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a console program, who's main features are an iostream interface for user interactions which handles all possible errors and inputs, utilization of libcurl and the Quandl API to fetch end of day stock market prices and build a stock price database, and saving, loading, and tracking information for each unique user who opens the program. </p>
